# JavaScript Express Server

This project contains an Express server implemented in JavaScript. It listens on port 8001 and uses Nodemon for automatic code reloading.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `src/index.js`: This file is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the Express app, sets the server to listen on port 8001, and includes middleware for logging.

- `src/routes/index.js`: This file is intended for defining routes. Currently, it does not export any routes since the server has no endpoints.

- `src/controllers/helloController.js`: This file is intended for handling logic related to a "hello" endpoint. It currently does not export any functions since there are no endpoints defined.

- `src/middleware/logger.js`: This file is intended for logging middleware. It currently does not export any functions since there are no endpoints defined.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies (including Express and Nodemon) and scripts for the project, including a start script that runs Nodemon.

- `yarn.lock`: This file is automatically generated by Yarn to lock the versions of dependencies.

- `nodemon.json`: This file contains configuration settings for Nodemon, specifying which files to watch for changes.

- `Dockerfile`: This file is used to build a Docker image for the Express server. It specifies the base image, copies the source code into the image, installs the dependencies, and sets the command to run the server.

- `.dockerignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored when building the Docker image.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

## Getting Started

To run the Express server using Nodemon, follow these steps:

- Install the dependencies by running the following command:

  ```shell
  yarn install
  ```

- Start the server with Nodemon by running:

  ```shell
  yarn start
  ```

- The Express server should now be running. You can access it at port `8001`.

## API Routes

Currently, there are no defined API routes in this server. You can add routes in the `src/routes/index.js` file as needed.
